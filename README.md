**please** do not dogfood without explicit support.


Concord is a system of distributed protocols on top of a block graph. Concord utilises non-wasteful PoW to promote meaningful and considerate computing.

### Roadmap

- [ ] PoW
  - [x] Hash Spam (Yuck)
  - [ ] ~~Lambda Calc (Clear)~~ (shelved to focus 100% on hme)
  - [ ] Homomorphic (Opaque)
