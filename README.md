# Concord/Core

Notice(s)
----
**[WIP]** unexpected things are expected; **please** do not dogfood without explicit support.

Functionality
----
Concord is a system of distributed protocols on top of a block graph. Concord utilises non-wasteful PoW to promote meaningful and considerate computing.

Core is moving towards pure storage abstraction functionality. To see a more complete overview of how to use concord, please see [structure](https://openconcord.org/structure).
