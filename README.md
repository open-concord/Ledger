# Concord/Core
<hr>

Notice(s)
----
**[WIP]** unexpected things are expected; **please** do not dogfood without explicit support.

Functionality
----
Concord is a system of distributed protocols on top of a block graph. Concord utilises non-wasteful PoW to promote meaningful and considerate computing.

Core is moving towards pure storage abstraction functionality; gradually all cryptographic functions strictly pertaining to cryptography will be removed. We recomend using the excellent [CryptoPP](https://cryptopp.com) library.

### Roadmap
- [x] graph
- [ ] PoW
  - [x] Hash Spam (Yuck)
  - [\] ~~Lambda Calc (Clear)~~ (shelved to focus 100% on hme)
  - [\] Homomorphic (Opaque) (moved to [tamuz](https://git.openconcord.org/tamuz))
